# Jammming
*A Project by Jeff Vergne*

This project is part of the **Fullstack Engineer Career** path from **CodeCademy**.
It is a practice project from the **React Part 2** module. 

## Objective
In this project, I will build a React web application called Jammming. I will use my knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

## Technology
Developped with React.
